        “Many of my films have strong female leads—brave, self-sufficient girls
        who don't think twice about fighting for what they believe in with all
        their heart. They'll need a friend, or a supporter, but never a savior.
        Any woman is just as capable of being a hero as any man.”
        <br /> — Hayao Miyazaki
